      <h2>At the same age, you and your friend were walking on the street, preparing to go to the gallery. As you passed by your favorite ice cream shop, it wasn't the craving for food that made you stop, but the sticky sensation on your hair. He spat on your head. How should you respond?

          <label for="choiceA">You feel your brain shutting down, not knowing how to respond. It's like every time, you don't know how to react. You turn around, facing the glaring sun, and see only his eyes staring at you. He follows you, and you wonder if responding will only make things worse and invite retaliation.

          <label for="choiceC"> You spit back at him. Then, if he continues to follow you, you stand your ground and ask him what he wants. You take out your phone and tell him that you'll call the police if he takes one more step. Alternatively, you can use Google Maps to navigate to the nearest police station and report him for following you.
