# I wish I had done something

As I stand here, I am reminded of the infinite choices we seem to have in life, yet our options are often limited. We are forced to confront situations where we feel helpless, unsure of how to proceed. For instance, being harassed in a car: I fear that I will never arrive at my destination, and the uncertainty of what might come next weighs heavily on my mind. In these moments, I find myself frozen, unable to make decisions, choosing silence, pretending nothing is happening, waiting for the dreadful moments to pass. My overthinking has caused nothing but pain.

我们看似被给予了很多很多选项，但其实能选的是非常有限的。比如说，在车上被骚扰你会担心会不会被开离目的地，在那之后又会发生什么呢？ 不知道。 因为我并没有做出这些选择，我的选择是沉默的，是假装没发生的。

But the question lingers in my mind — to resist or not to resist? I face a power imbalance, a fragile mental state, and I realize that bravery eludes me. I lack courage in every moment.  

所以有时候我会想，到底要不要反抗？对于力量的悬殊，精神上的不稳定性。 我是一个没有勇气的人，每一次在脑海里模拟会发生的事情只给我带来了痛苦。我也经常后悔为什么自己没有选择另外一种。

Growing up as an East Asian woman in a traditional environment, my gender and sexual orientation were predetermined for me, leaving me with little choice in the matter. As I embarked on a journey of self-discovery, I often found myself faced with a dearth of options, struggling to find a path that felt authentic and true to who I am.

对于成长于一个传统环境中的东亚女性，在成长的过程中，性别和性取向并不是我可以选择的。在自我探寻的过程中，很多时候都没有可选项可以选择。

Before doing this test, understand that everything that appears — thoughts, experiences, guesses, distinctions between good and evil — is from what I perceive, based on my authority.

在做这个测试之前，请记得在测试中出现的所有东西- 想法，经历，猜测，对善恶之分，都是来自我所感知到的。

The concept of good and evil in my mind is determined by my degree of like or dislike for something. For example, when I see a roach, I define it as evil because I am afraid of insects. For many, a roach may be a lovely creature, and I respect people's preferences and perspectives. Alternatively, consider the "good behavior" mentioned in the test. To me, these choices represent how the standard of "good" has been instilled in my ears since childhood, based on their socially constructed definitions. But who makes the rules? My mother's definition of goodness, which was taught to me, may have been something she heard from someone else who heard it from others. You may not agree with me entirely, and I accept your disagreement.

我心中的善恶是由我对这件事情的喜恶程度而决定的。比如看见蟑螂，我把它定义是恶的是因为我害怕虫子，所以对我而言它是恶的。对你而言，蟑螂可以是可爱的生物，而我尊重每一种看法。又或者说测试中提到的“好事”，这些好事对我来说代表着从小耳目渲染大人们口中的“好”，是一种基于很多很多人定义中的好，就像我妈对我传播的对于善的定义可能是她从别人那里听来的，那些别人又是从别人那里听来的。你可以完全不认同，并且我接受你的不认同。

In this test, it may appear that you have been given an abundance of options, yet you can only choose to become either a Chenpi or a roach.

这个测试中你看似被给予了非常多的机会，但其实你能选择成为的只有“陈皮”和蟑螂。

How can a roach become a human in the next cycle of life?

蟑螂要怎么成为人呢？

In theory, by doing good deeds, experiencing various deaths, and trying again and again. Through cycles of rebirth, renewal, and "choice."

通过做好事，通过不同的死亡，通过一次又一次的尝试。通过一次次的轮回，重生，选择。

And how does one become Chenpi? The answer is uncertain, but in my world, it is your only choice. Of course, you can choose death or give up at any moment. The death I predict is simulated, a decision stemming from powerlessness.

而人要怎么成为陈皮呢？不知道，这是你唯一的选择。当然你也可以随时选择死亡，逃离我预测中的死亡，一种模拟的死亡。 一种关于无力感的体验。 

Welcome to my experienced world. 
那我们从头开始吧。

Let's start from the beginning.
