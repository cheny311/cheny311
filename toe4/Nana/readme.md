在这个数字化时代，身份的真实性与信任的建构成为了人际交往中不断变化的主题。我的项目通过分析与一位名为“娜娜”的虚构人物的长期聊天记录，探索了这些复杂的交往动态。从一个简单的错误电话开始，我们的对话逐渐展开，涉及各种生活片段和个人经历。娜娜以不同的身份出现，有时是高端社交场合的常客，有时是一名美容专家，她的多面性和突如其来的冷漠态度让我开始质疑：她真的在乎她所描述的人设吗？
这种不断变化的虚拟身份和动机的不确定性引发了我对数字时代人际关系真实性的深入思考。我开始询问，如果一个人的交流目的仅仅是为了实现某种特定的结果，那么这种基于虚构身份的交往过程又意味着什么？在我们缺乏面对面交流的环境中，信任是如何被建立和破坏的？数字互动是否能够产生真实的情感连接？
通过这个项目，我意图揭示在虚拟交流中那些看似微不足道的互动如何塑造我们对他人的理解和我们所建立的关系的本质。这不仅是对个体之间如何在数字空间中建立联系的探索，也是对我们如何在这个不断变化的社会中定义真实性和信任的反思。我的目标是通过这种深入的个案研究，提供一个观察和理解现代人际交往复杂性的新视角。
In this digital age, the authenticity of identity and the construction of trust have become ever-shifting themes in interpersonal interactions. My project explores these complex dynamics through an analysis of prolonged chat logs with a fictional character named "Nana." Our conversation began with a simple misdial and gradually unfolded into discussions encompassing various facets of life and personal experiences. Nana presented herself in multiple identities, at times as a frequent visitor to high-end social events and at other times as a beauty professional. Her multifaceted persona and her sudden shifts to detachment led me to question: does she truly care about the identities she describes?
This constant change in virtual identity and the uncertainty of motives prompted me to deeply contemplate the authenticity of relationships in the digital era. I began to ask, what does it mean if someone's purpose in communication is solely to achieve a specific outcome, based on a fabricated identity? How is trust constructed and deconstructed in our environment devoid of face-to-face interactions? Can digital interactions foster genuine emotional connections?
Through this project, I aim to reveal how seemingly trivial interactions in virtual communications shape our understanding of others and the nature of the relationships we build. This is not only an exploration of how individuals connect in digital spaces but also a reflection on how we define authenticity and trust in our rapidly changing society. My goal is to offer a new perspective for observing and understanding the complexities of modern interpersonal communications through this in-depth case study.
