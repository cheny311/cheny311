                  I explore how people often have few choices when their options may seem abundant. I focus on my own life as an East Asian woman to demonstrate the social constraints that we face. Generally, Asian women grow up with many rules about how to act, what to enjoy, and who to be. These rules make it difficult for us to choose our own paths. In this simple word game, people have two pathways that they can take, one is to be a woman, and the other is to be a roach. The audience needs to follow different events or restrictions to reach a conclusion of who/what they are.

              A group project that created a microphone for people to use when giving speeches in our game, “Peach’s Speech.” The microphone was shaped as a mushroom and registered noise levels which corresponded with timed unity events in the game. We used multiple analog output audio sensors to get averaged sound data about when the player spoke into the mushroom. Our controller and game made the player engaged with the relationship between power and voice, and how different political tones can be represented through sound. Different parts of the mushroom are more or less audio-sensitive, so people have to explore the controller to better understand how to make effective points. This is mirrored in game in that the player uses specific ways of speaking to make effective arguments to rouse the audiences of Goombas, Koopas, and Cheep Cheeps. Some parts of the microphone are more or less receptive to each of the groups, which represents the different needs and hopes of the groups within the audience.

              I draw inspiration from the term “Smart,” which is a localized aesthetic of visual kei which was popular in the early 2000s. I reflected on times I’ve taken headshots in photo booths with friends, but I wanted to make the filters easily accessible. I tried to create the sense of having fun with things that cannot be put into words.

              The original form of this project is a book made by hand. I created the story based on my confusion growing up as I grappled with the term “expectation.” I enjoy feeling the textures of the physical materials, but this version is not widely available to others. Therefore, I decided to have a 2D version of the original story with improvements afforded by technology.

              Inspired by visual kei’s “smart” and the “Martian text,” or a text that is unreadable and filled with decorative elements, I found a way to express the ineffable. Because I used an indecipherable language, I created a sense of security for my vulnerability within a familiar aesthetic. In this project, I talk about the pain that I physically feel every day and how it comes spontaneously. Even though my pain is physical, I do not say anything. Hair, on the other hand, has no feelings, and it serves as a way to visualize my unspoken pain.

              In this digital era, the authenticity of identity and the construction of trust are scrutinized more than ever, as people online may present themselves as someone or something different from who they really are. My project explores these complex dynamics in online communication through an analysis of prolonged chat logs with a person who identified as a fictional character named "Nana." Our conversation began with a simple misdial and gradually unfolded into discussions encompassing various facets of life and personal experiences. 
              Nana presented herself in multiple identities, at times as a frequent visitor of high-end social events and at other times as a beauty professional. Her multifaceted personas and sudden shifts to detachment led me to question: Does she truly see herself in the identities she describes?
              This constant change in virtual identity and the uncertainty of motives prompted me to contemplate the authenticity of relationships and constructed selves. I began to ask, What does it mean if someone's purpose in communication is solely to achieve a specific outcome, based on a fabricated identity? How is trust constructed and deconstructed in an environment devoid of face-to-face interaction? Can exclusively digital interactions foster genuine emotional connection?
              Through this project, I aim to reveal how seemingly trivial interactions in virtual spaces shape our understanding of others and the nature of the relationships we build. This is not only an exploration of how individuals connect in digital spaces but also a reflection on how we define authenticity and trust in our rapidly changing, impersonal society.
